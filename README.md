# Wordle word finder

This is my first Java project! The scripts will find all the possible wordle words given the greens, yellows, and grays.

Note: This code might not be optimized or the best. It's my first time using Java.

<hr>

To run:
- Download `main.java` and `main.py`.
- Run `main.py` once to create `WordList.txt`.
- Run `main.java` and check the console or `Output.txt`.
